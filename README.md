# Library-Management-Using-OOPS

Here We have used OOPS concept in Java to implement a console where user can ask the details of the book such as name of the book, author, subject and get the complete the details of the wished book

OOPS Concepts used here are:
1. **Classes and Objects**: In OOP, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. Objects, on the other hand, are instances of classes that represent real-world entities. Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) related to the objects they represent.

2. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together within a class, restricting access to the internal state of objects. It allows for data hiding and provides a level of data protection, ensuring that the internal implementation details are hidden from the outside world.

3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behavior from an existing class (superclass or base class). It allows for code reuse, promoting the "is-a" relationship between classes.

4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or as instances of their child class. It enables a single interface to represent different data types, and it can be achieved through method overloading or method overriding.

5. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes at the appropriate level of detail. It allows developers to focus on the essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary implementation details. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in OOP.
